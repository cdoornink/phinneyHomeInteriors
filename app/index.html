        <p>Studio McGee was created in a spare bedroom with lots of big ideas and no room for fabric samples. After many late nights of brainstorming and collaboration, husband and wife team, Syd and Shea McGee decided to take what was a small business for a stay-at-home mom and turn it into something much more.</p>
        <p>After graduating with a degree in Public Relations, Shea realized that what she really wanted to do was design. A few semesters into design school, her bright and clean aesthetic had attracted a waiting list of clients and no idea how to handle the workload.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Syd had worked for six years to build a start-up digital marketing firm that was acquired and left him searching for a new start-up to dive into. He soon realized there was the perfect candidate right in front of him.</p>
        <p>Their team’s work has garnered attention in the design world from House Beautiful, Domaine Home, Design*Sponge, Apartment Therapy, SMP Living, and One King’s Lane to name a few.</p>

By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.</div>
